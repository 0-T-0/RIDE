= General =

This document describes the technical process of contributing code in the RIDE
project.

In general, sending patches is the way to start contributing. Patches should
follow the guidelines described below. After submitting some number of accepted
patches, commit rights may be given.


= Project information =

RIDE is hosted in Google Code service [1]. All information about commits, code
reviews and changes in issue tracker are sent to ride-code mailing list [2].
For development discussion, robotframework-devel mailing listÂ [3] is used.


= Source code =

Source code is hosted in the Google Code Subversion repository [4], which
also supports read-only anonymous checkouts.


= Coding guidelines =

In general, all the code should be written according to Style Guide for Python
Code [5] However, as stated in the Zen of Python, practicality beats purity.

== Method names ==

Typically, we use `lowercase_with_underscore` style for method names. Of
course, when overriding wx methods, `AllCapitalized` style must be used.
Additionally, there's a special case when writing event handler methods. We
have chosen to name event handlers following this pattern: `OnEventName` (e.g.
`OnMouseClick`).

== Variable names ==

Instance variables also follow the `lowercase_with_underscore` naming
convention.  Additionally, a leading underscore indicates that the variable is
considered private.

Global variables (provided there's really a need for such) use `ALL_CAPS`
style.

== Getters and setters ==

We follow the Pythonic way of not implementing getters and setters in the case
where direct attribute access is sufficient


= Tests =

Unfortunately we do not currently have high level automated test cases.
However, all new code should have unit test written for it. These unit tests
are included in the `utest` directory. To execute all unit tests, run

	python utest/run_utests.py

The `atest` folder contains some tests for serialization. These tests read data
in RIDE and serialize it right back. Then both the original and modified suite
is executed, and results compared. These test may be run with command (in atest
directory)

	python test_golden.py golden
